@  Documentation outlining the steps for initializing UART1, configuring system exceptions, and setting up interrupts in STM32:

______________

1. System Initialization (HAL_MspInit)
Set Priority Grouping: Configure interrupt priority grouping for the Cortex-M processor.
Enable System Exceptions: Enable critical system exceptions (Memory Fault, Bus Fault, Usage Fault).
Set Exception Priorities: Set the highest priority for the system exceptions.
2. UART1 Initialization (HAL_UART_MspInit)
Enable Clocks: Enable the clocks for UART1 and GPIOA.
Configure GPIO Pins: Set PA9 for UART TX and PA10 for UART RX with appropriate alternate functions.
Enable Interrupts: Enable UART1 interrupt and set its priority.
3. Main Initialization (main.c)
Initialize HAL: Initialize the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).
Configure System Clock: Set up the system clock (HSI used by default).
Initialize UART1: Set parameters such as baud rate, word length, stop bits, and parity for UART1.
Receive and Transmit Data: Continuously receive data from UART1 and send it back.
