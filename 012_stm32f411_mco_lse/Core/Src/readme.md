# STM32 Low-Level Peripheral Initialization – Goal and Steps

This document outlines the goal and steps required to initialize the system, GPIO pins, and the HAL MSP (Microcontroller Support Package) on an STM32 microcontroller. The final goal is to configure the microcontroller for basic GPIO operation and ensure the MSP initialization for the system.

---

## Goal:

The final output of this code is:

- **System Clock Configuration**: Configures the microcontroller to use the High-Speed Internal (HSI) oscillator and sets up the PLL to provide an appropriate clock source for the system.
- **GPIO Initialization**: Configures GPIO pins to enable the MCO (Microcontroller Clock Output) functionality on pin `PC9`.
- **Clock Output**: The configured system clock is output on pin `PC9` for monitoring purposes.

## Steps for Peripheral Initialization

### 1. **HAL_Init** – HAL Initialization

**Goal**: Initialize the HAL library to set up the basic system infrastructure.

**Steps**:
- **Initialize the HAL Library**: The `HAL_Init()` function is called to initialize the HAL library. This includes setting up the Flash prefetch buffer, Flash latency, and configuring the SysTick timer for timekeeping and delays.

---

### 2. **SystemClock_Config** – System Clock Configuration

**Goal**: Configure the system clock to ensure the microcontroller operates correctly and efficiently.

**Steps**:
- **Configure the Power Supply**: The `__HAL_RCC_PWR_CLK_ENABLE()` function is called to enable the power interface clock, followed by setting the voltage scaling with `__HAL_PWR_VOLTAGESCALING_CONFIG(PWR_REGULATOR_VOLTAGE_SCALE1)` for optimal power consumption.
- **Initialize Oscillators**: The system clock is set to use the High-Speed Internal (HSI) oscillator with `RCC_OscInitStruct.OscillatorType = RCC_OSCILLATORTYPE_HSI`. Additionally, the High-Speed External (HSE) oscillator is enabled, but the Low-Speed External (LSE) oscillator is disabled.
- **Configure PLL for System Clock**: The Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) is configured with HSI as the source, with parameters set for the desired output frequency (`PLLM = 8`, `PLLN = 192`, `PLLP = RCC_PLLP_DIV4`, `PLLQ = 8`).
- **Set Clock Dividers**: The system clock (`SYSCLK`) is set to be derived from the PLL output. The AHB, APB1, and APB2 clock dividers are configured to ensure proper clock distribution across the microcontroller.
- **MCO2 Output**: The `HAL_RCC_MCOConfig()` function is used to output the HSE clock on pin `PC9` for monitoring the system clock.

### 3. **MX_GPIO_Init** – GPIO Initialization

**Goal**: Configure the GPIO pins for MCO output.

**Steps**:
- **Enable GPIO Clocks**: The clocks for the GPIO ports are enabled with `__HAL_RCC_GPIOC_CLK_ENABLE()` for port C, which includes pin `PC9` for MCO output.
- **Configure GPIO Pin for MCO (PC9)**: Pin `PC9` is configured as an alternate function (AF) push-pull output to route the clock signal for external observation. The pin is set to a low-speed mode with no pull-up or pull-down resistor.

---

### 4. **Main Loop** – Infinite Loop

**Goal**: Set up an infinite loop for the main program execution.

**Steps**:
- The `main()` function enters an infinite loop after the initialization, where no additional functionality is implemented in this example.

---

### 5. **HAL_MspInit** – MSP Initialization

**Goal**: Set up the low-level MSP initialization.

**Steps**:
- The MSP initialization ensures that the system is prepared to handle hardware resources (such as clocks and interrupts). However, this code does not explicitly add any custom MSP configurations, as the initialization process is handled in the HAL functions like `HAL_Init()` and `SystemClock_Config()`.

---

### 6. **Error_Handler** – Error Handling

**Goal**: Handle errors by entering an infinite loop.

**Steps**:
- **Enter Infinite Loop on Error**: The `Error_Handler()` function disables interrupts and enters an infinite loop if there is a failure in any peripheral initialization or configuration.

---

## Final Output Behavior

- **Clock Output**: The system clock is routed to `PC9` (MCO2 output), providing a real-time view of the HSE clock.
- **System Clock Configuration**: The system operates with the HSI oscillator as the clock source, with the PLL used to adjust the frequency for the system’s needs.
- **GPIO Control**: GPIO pin `PC9` is configured as the output for the system clock, allowing external monitoring of the HSE frequency.

---

## Additional Information

### System Configuration and Clocks:
- **HSI Oscillator**: The High-Speed Internal (HSI) oscillator is used as the system clock source for this configuration.
- **PLL Configuration**: The PLL is used to scale the HSI clock frequency to the desired level, with output divided appropriately for system and peripheral clocks.

### GPIO Configuration:
- **MCO Output (PC9)**: The clock output is routed to `PC9`, enabling monitoring of the system clock on an external oscilloscope or logic analyzer.
